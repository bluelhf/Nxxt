  ### Windows Defender
  Running Nxxt between versions B1 and B2 might greet you with a "Windows protected your PC" screen.

  This is Windows Defender's SmartScreen. It recognises .exe files with no publisher
  and gives you a fair warning. To run the executable anyways (in case you see this),
  click on the "More Info" text and then click the "Run Anyway" button.
