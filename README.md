# Nxxt üñ±Ô∏è
### Have you ever had to click? Sucks, right?

Nxxt (/n…õkst/) is a program made to do all the clicking for you.  
Whether you like it fast and hard or nice and slow ;), Nxxt's got you covered.  

[Download it](https://github.com/bluelhf/Nxxt/releases/download/b4/Nxxt-b4.jar). You know you want to.  
<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Built for Java 16**</sup>

## üåü Features
‚≠ê **Dark mode!**  
‚≠ê Configurable keybinds  
‚≠ê Delay LFO (to bypass autoclicker detection!)  
‚≠ê Configurable jitter-click mode  
‚≠ê Three different click types  
‚≠ê Configurable click delay (with a "Maximum Speed" option)  

## üíî Broke something?

If at any time you want to kill Nxxt as quickly as possible, there's a few hidden shortcuts for you:
- **Ctrl / Cmd + End** - Terminates the program immediately
- **Ctrl / Cmd + Del** - Causes the program to crash

On Windows, opening Windows Security via Ctrl + Alt + Del or having the window focus on Task Manager causes Nxxt to stop clicking.

  ### Windows Defender
  Running Nxxt between versions B1 and B2 might greet you with a "Windows protected your PC" screen.

  This is Windows Defender's SmartScreen. It recognises .exe files with no publisher
  and gives you a fair warning. To run the executable anyways (in case you see this),
  click on the "More Info" text and then click the "Run Anyway" button.

## How to end it?
